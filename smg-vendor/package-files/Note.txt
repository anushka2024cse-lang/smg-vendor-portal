Package File Note

This folder contains a package.json and package-lock.json used for
vendor list, vendor details, and component-related features.

The package.json included here contains the dependencies required for
these features and includes both frontend- and backend-related packages.
React 18 was used for stability and compatibility during development.

The package.json and package-lock.json present outside this folder use
React 19 and are intended for frontend usage. Kindly choose or apply
changes to the package files based on project requirements.

Before running the project, please ensure that:
- Only one package.json and one package-lock.json exist in the root directory
- There are no duplicate package files that could cause dependency or version conflicts
